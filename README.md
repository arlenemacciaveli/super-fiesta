Shamelessly ripped components from https://github.com/hodgerpodger/staketaxcsv -  Thanks for doing all the hard work.
This code does only one thing, It gets the transactions for the {chihuahua, lum,desmos and juno} blockchains and makes a CSV of those transactions using API calls.

I am not a programmer; I wanted the data for tax purposes in Koinly format. So I pulled some fast tricks, so use them at your own risk if you know what you are doing. 
Thanks for the amazing Reddit community.

For OSMO and ATOM transactions, use: https://stake.tax/. 
Another tool that works can be found at https://apollo-export.io/


# Install

  1. Install python 3.9
  2. Install pip packages (mostly the requirements of https://github.com/hodgerpodger/staketaxcsv)
 
 
# Usage

1. Replace the dummy wallet address in the __wallet.txt__ file.

2. Run python3 __report_coin.py__

3. Brace and pray for the best.

4. If you are lucky, then the report will be in the __\_reports__ folder; rinse and repeat for other networks by changing the wallet address

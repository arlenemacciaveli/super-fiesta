Shamelessed ripped components from https://github.com/hodgerpodger/staketaxcsv -  Thanks for doing all the hardwork.
This code does only one thing, It gets the transactions for the {chihuahua,lum,desmos and juno} blockchains and the makes a csv of those transactions using api calls.

I am not a programmer, I wanted the data for tax purposes in Koinly format. so I pulled some fast tricks, so use under your own risk, if you know what you are doing. 
Thanks for the amazing reddit community.

For OSMO and ATOM trasactions use: https://stake.tax/. 
Another tool that works can be found at https://apollo-export.io/


__Usage:__ 

1.Replace the dummy wallet address in the __wallet.txt__ file.

2.run python3 __report_coin.py__

3.Brace and pray for the best.

4.If you are lucky, then the report will be in the __\_reports__ folder

Shamelessed ripped components from https://github.com/hodgerpodger/staketaxcsv -  Thanks for doing all the hardwork.
This code does only one thing, It gets the transactions  for the chihuahua blockchain and the makes a csv of those transactions using api calls.

I am not a programmer, I wanted the data for tax purposes in Koinly format. so I pulled some fast tricks, so use under your own risk, if you know what you are doing. 
Thanks for the amazing chihuahua community.
